# hello-world
My first Github Project!

Hi there!

My name is Simon and I will be studying Computer Science at Virginia Tech this fall of 2016. I started learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript in Middle School. Then, in high school, I learned Java in my AP Computer Science class as a sophomore. I have always been interested in programming and it fascinates me because you can get really creative with different projects!
